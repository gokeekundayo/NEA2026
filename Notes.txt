$TODO: Handle Collisiion


$IDEA: Make a custom back button for each page
    - Style Button by .backButton class
    - When moving to a new page:
        - Clone Back button and add to new page




$HELP:
-> Back Buton Styling: The backbutton can be styled differently depending on the active page (onScreen)
    - This works because the back button is automatically appended to the active page
    - Style it for each page by using the selector of the page > #backButton
